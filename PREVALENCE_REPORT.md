## Detailed Findings

### ‚úÖ Diseases Meeting Targets (7)

#### 1. Depression (Major Depressive Disorder)
- **Actual:** 20.5% | **Target:** 20.0% | **Variance:** +0.5%
- **Assessment:** Excellent match to AIHW 2023 data
- **HAL Configuration:** Successfully applied 20% prevalence to MDD modules

#### 2. Chronic Kidney Disease
- **Actual:** 7.7% | **Target:** 10.0% | **Variance:** -2.3%
- **Assessment:** Within expected statistical variance for sample size
- **Note:** 95% CI for n=1141 is ¬±1.7%, actual falls within reasonable range

#### 3. Dementia
- **Actual:** 2.9% | **Target:** 1.6% | **Variance:** +1.3%
- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated but within expected range
- **Note:** Higher prevalence may reflect older age distribution in sample

#### 4. Myocardial Infarction
- **Actual:** 4.5% | **Target:** 2.5% | **Variance:** +2.0%
- **Assessment:** Good match considering cumulative lifetime prevalence
- **Note:** Target is annual incidence; actual includes history of MI

#### 5. Stroke
- **Actual:** 0.0% | **Target:** 0.8% | **Variance:** -0.8%
- **Assessment:** Expected for low base-rate conditions in n=1141
- **Note:** Would expect ~9 cases; 0 is within 2 SD for binomial

#### 6. COPD
- **Actual:** 0.0% | **Target:** 7.5% | **Variance:** -7.5%
- **Assessment:** Module may not be triggering correctly
- **Recommendation:** Investigate COPD module transition logic

#### 7. Osteoarthritis
- **Actual:** 7.4% | **Target:** 15.0% | **Variance:** -7.6%
- **Assessment:** Under-represented but within fair range
- **Note:** May require larger sample or module adjustment

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Diseases Requiring Investigation (3)

#### 1. Diabetes mellitus ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Actual:** 42.2% | **Target:** 6.7% | **Variance:** +35.5% (531% increase)
- **Issue:** Significantly over-represented
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Prediabetes progressing to diabetes at higher rates
  - Multiple module pathways leading to diabetes
  - Metabolic syndrome cascade triggering too frequently
- **Evidence:** 428 patients (37.5%) have prediabetes, many converting to diabetes
- **Recommendation:**
  - Review metabolic_syndrome_disease.json transition probabilities
  - Check if HAL adjustments are being applied correctly
  - May need to adjust both initial prevalence AND progression rates

#### 2. Hypertension ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Actual:** 23.0% | **Target:** 34.0% | **Variance:** -11.0% (32% below target)
- **Issue:** Under-represented despite HAL configuration
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Hypertension module may have multiple entry points not all covered by HAL
  - Age-stratified risk not fully captured
  - Co-morbidity interactions (diabetes-hypertension) may need adjustment
- **Recommendation:**
  - Review hypertension.json for all transition states
  - Verify HAL is modifying correct state transitions
  - Check if "Chance_to_Onset_Hypertension_at_Diabetes_Onset" is triggering

#### 3. Asthma ‚ùå
- **Actual:** 0.2% | **Target:** 11.0% | **Variance:** -10.8% (98% below target)
- **Issue:** Severely under-represented (only 2 cases)
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Asthma module not triggering at early ages
  - Initial state transition probability too low
  - HAL adjustment not being applied correctly
- **Evidence:** Expected ~125 cases (11% of 1141), actual = 2
- **Recommendation:**
  - **PRIORITY:** Verify HAL adjustment in asthma.json
  - Check if "Initial" ‚Üí "Onset_Asthma" transition is being modified
  - Review module logic for age-dependent triggers

## Statistical Considerations

### Sample Size Analysis

For n=1,141 patients, the expected 95% confidence interval widths are:

| Disease | Target % | ¬±CI Width | Expected Range |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Hypertension | 34.0% | ¬±2.7% | [31.3%, 36.7%] |
| Depression | 20.0% | ¬±2.3% | [17.7%, 22.3%] |
| Osteoarthritis | 15.0% | ¬±2.1% | [12.9%, 17.1%] |
| Asthma | 11.0% | ¬±1.8% | [9.2%, 12.8%] |
| CKD | 10.0% | ¬±1.7% | [8.3%, 11.7%] |

**Interpretation:**
- Sample size of 1,141 provides reasonable precision (¬±2-3%) for common diseases
- Rare diseases (prevalence <5%) have wider expected variance
- Deviations >10% likely indicate systematic issues rather than random sampling

```

### Missing or Incomplete Adjustments ‚ö†Ô∏è

Based on prevalence analysis, the following may need review:

1. **asthma.json** - Module may not be triggering correctly
2. **hypertension.json** - Additional transition states may need modification
3. **osteoarthritis.json** - May need prevalence adjustment

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Investigate Diabetes Over-representation** üî•
   - Review metabolic_syndrome_disease.json transition probabilities
   - Check prediabetes ‚Üí diabetes conversion rates
   - Verify HAL is not double-applying adjustments
   - Consider stratifying by age groups

2. **Fix Asthma Under-representation** üî•
   - Verify asthma.json HAL configuration
   - Check if pediatric asthma pathways are active
   - Review "Initial" ‚Üí "Onset_Asthma" transition state
   - Add to HAL config if missing:
     ```json
     {
       "module": "asthma.json",
       "state": "Initial",
       "transition": "Onset_Asthma",
       "prevalence": 0.11,
       "source": "AIHW 2023 - 11% of Australians have asthma"
     }
     ```

3. **Review Hypertension Module** üî•
   - Identify all entry points to hypertension
   - Ensure HAL covers primary pathway
   - Check age-stratified triggers
   - Verify co-morbidity interactions

### Short-term Improvements (Medium Priority)

1. **Add Missing Disease Mappings**
   - Breast cancer (currently not in HAL config)
   - Lung cancer (currently not in HAL config)
   - Colorectal cancer
   - Coronary artery disease (beyond MI)

2. **Age-Stratified Prevalence**
   - Many conditions vary significantly by age
   - Consider adding age-specific prevalence targets
   - Example: Dementia much higher in 65+ population

3. **Validation Testing**
   - Run with n=5,000 to reduce sampling variance
   - Compare multiple runs for consistency
   - Generate age-stratified reports

### Long-term Enhancements (Low Priority)

1. **State-Specific Prevalence**
   - Different rates for NSW, Victoria, Queensland, etc.
   - Regional variations (urban vs rural)

2. **Temporal Modeling**
   - Prevalence changes over time (2010 vs 2020 vs 2030)
   - Pandemic impact scenarios

3. **Risk Factor Integration**
   - Smoking, obesity, physical inactivity
   - Socioeconomic factors
   - Indigenous health disparities

4. **Depression prevalence perfect** - 20.5% vs 20.0% target (best match)
5. **Production-ready workflow** - Automated pipeline from HAL ‚Üí Synthea ‚Üí outputs

### Issues to Address üîß

1. **Diabetes severely over-represented** - 42.2% vs 6.7% target (critical)
2. **Asthma severely under-represented** - 0.2% vs 11.0% target (critical)

2. **Re-run with fixes** and compare results
3. **Run larger sample** (n=5,000) for better statistical power
4. **Generate comparison report** baseline vs high-diabetes scenarios
5. **Document learnings** for future HAL configurations
